## Course Description

In response to global environmental challenges, city governments worldwide have developed ambitious long-term greenhouse gas emission targets, heavily focused on reducing and managing building energy demands. While energy use is a key factor in producing a sustainable and resilient built environment, very few individuals will move into a neighborhood solely because it consists of low energy buildings. More urgent selection criteria beyond safety include stimulating  
nearby jobs, good schools, and a diversity of entertainment opportunities as well as healthy and attractive indoor and outdoor spaces that support human-powered transportation. A balanced urban planning approach is hence needed that supports the design of vibrant mixed-use and pedestrian-friendly innovating districts—along with their organic food oases and yoga studios—the likes of which have evolved worldwide from Cambridge to London and Seoul.

This hands-on survey course deals with the fundamentals and application of environmental urban performance simulations to urban design. Core topics include operational and embodied building energy use and affiliated carbon emissions, access to daylight, neighborhood walkability, and outdoor thermal comfort. Additional topics that we will be reviewing are basic cash flow models to compare the economic viability of competing neighborhood proposals including health “co-benefits” as well as the simulation of crop yields from urban container farms. Throughout the term, students will work in groups and apply the course content to develop a neighborhood proposal for select sites in Chicago, Munich, and San Francisco. A third focus area of the class is the impact assessment of climate change and the urban heat island effects on long-term building energy use and comfort. Previous course projects can be found at the MIT Sustainable Design Lab web site.

The class is open to all members of the MIT community. Previous exposure to building technology (through classes such as 4.401/4.464 and 4.421), design, and/or urban planning is an asset since we will be working at the interface of these three fields. The instructor will ensure that all student groups are well balanced and have members representing all three disciplines.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand the various physical effects that generate urban microclimates and their impact on building energy use, carbon emissions, and thermal/luminous comfort in cities.
- Evaluate new and existing neighborhoods regarding key environmental performance indicators including energy consumption, material consumption, daylight hours, outdoor comfort, and neighborhood walkability.
- Run computer simulations for such metrics, using 3D models generated in Rhinoceros using MIT’s {{% resource_link "2b126ac0-92ff-44db-8593-77b0affd24f6" "Urban Modeling Interface" %}}.
- Conduct a series of design interventions to improve these performance indicators for a given neighborhood design.

Work for the class will be divided into a series of homework assignments that successively build up to a mixed-use neighborhood proposal that will include several hundred residential and commercial buildings and is linked to ongoing projects at the MIT Sustainable Design Lab. A key task for all groups will be the use of digital analysis methods to build a convincing argument as to why a particular proposal deserves to be called 'sustainable'. The instructor and members of the Sustainable Design Lab will closely work with all student groups on defining overall project goals and specific deliverables. Possible design questions students will be able to explore are:

- What urban building massing solutions ideally balance access to daylight and annual building energy use?
- Will natural ventilation still be an option for residential buildings in Munich in 50 years?
- How do density and urban form affect outdoor thermal comfort conditions?
- Can we create net zero, mixed-use communities in Chicago’s harsh climate?

## Course Requirements

Attendance and active participation in all lectures and labs is mandatory. Timely completion of all assignments is also required. Assignment types and grading weights are listed below. Presentations for the semester-long project will be graded based on the clarity of the project’s objectives, originality and inner logic of the design, sophistication of analysis techniques used, and comprehensiveness of the final design.

 

- Active participation in class (10% of grade)
- Assignment 1: Project Goals and Urban Layout Study (5% of grade)
- Assignment 2: Protoblock Daylighting (5% of grade)
- Assignment 3: Protoblock Energy (5% of grade)
- Presentation I: Initial Protoblock Design (10% of grade)
- Assignment 4: Protoblock Embodied Energy and Climate Change (7% of grade)
- Assignment 5: Energy Supply Scenarios and Neighborhood Mobility (7% of grade)
- Presentation II: Neighborhood Energy Supply and Comfort (16% of grade)
- Assignment 6: Urban Food Supply (5% of grade)
- Final Presentation: Sustainable Neighborhood Concept (25% of grade)
- Assignment 7: Neighborhood Package (5% of grade)

## Software and Tools

Throughout the course, we will be using a Rhinoceros/Grasshopper-based urban modeling environment called UMI as well as a series of compatible, third-party Grasshopper components. UMI enables urban designers to model new and/or existing neighborhoods regarding operational energy, embodied energy, daylight, thermal comfort, and neighborhood walkability. Selected UMI modules can be used in Grasshopper for parametric urban design analysis and optimization. Detailed software installation instructions and support will be provided in class and during lab. Additional custom tools will be prepared when required during the course depending on student needs for the semester projects. The specific programs used are:

## Academic Integrity

As in any other MIT course and especially in a research context, plagiarism and cheating are not acceptable. Never turn in an assignment that is not your own work, or products that do not include your own work as part of team assignment. If necessary, please refamiliarize yourself with the MIT Academic Integrity Handbook, which can be downloaded from {{% resource_link "9650ca3e-d07a-4161-b6a3-4361a096de42" "http://web.mit.edu/academicintegrity/" %}}.
