  "course_title": "Modeling Urban Energy Flows: Towards Sustainable Cities and Neighborhoods",
  "course_description": "This hands-on survey course deals with the fundamentals and application of environmental urban performance simulations to urban design. Core topics include operational and embodied building energy use and affiliated carbon emissions, access to daylight, neighborhood walkability, and outdoor thermal comfort. Additional topics that we will be reviewing are basic cash flow models to compare the economic viability of competing neighborhood proposals including health \u201cco-benefits\u201d as well as the simulation of crop yields from urban container farms.",
